### Idea of WTFood
Yelp helped me a lot on finding delicious restaurants when I'm studying at Portland. Therefore, I built this app for practicing my development skills. The first version of WTFood will be an Android App built in Java with other 3 teammates.<Link: https://github.com/yen311/WTFood_AndroidStudio> This one will be the web version of WTFood. It's not fancy as Yelp, but at least the basic searching function work :).
